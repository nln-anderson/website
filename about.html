            <h1>My Story</h1>
            <p>I grew up in the South Bay of Los Angeles and graduated from South High School in 2020. Given that I tutor math, 
                you may think that I was always good at math. The reality is the opposite - I struggled at math in middle school, 
                especially Algebra 1, barely passing my classes. I know what it is like to feel lost and confused in math. In high school,
                with the help of tutors and online resources, I started to excel in math. I ultimately took AP Calculus BC my junior
                year and scored a 5 on the test! I also received a Spartan Laurel award for my achievement in Mathematics. 
                That summer, I began working at a local tutoring center, with the hopes of helping others. Since then, I have begun
                tutoring independently. I tutored through the pandemic, so I was able to master teaching learning on an online setting. 
                I recently graduated Summa Cum Laude from the University of San Diego with a degree in Mathematics! Outside of school, 
                I love to surf, sail, and play guitar.</p>
